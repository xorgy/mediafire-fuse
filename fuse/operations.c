/* what you can safely assume about requests to your filesystem
 *
 * from: http://sourceforge.net/p/fuse/wiki/FuseInvariants/
 *
 * There are a number of assumptions that one can safely make when
 * implementing a filesystem using fuse. This page should be completed with a
 * set of such assumptions.
 *
 *  - All requests are absolute, i.e. all paths begin with "/" and include the
 *    complete path to a file or a directory. Symlinks, "." and ".." are
 *    already resolved.
 *
 *  - For every request you can get except for "Getattr()", "Read()" and
 *    "Write()", usually for every path argument (both source and destination
 *    for link and rename, but only the source for symlink), you will get a
 *    "Getattr()" request just before the callback.
 *
 * For example, suppose I store file names of files in a filesystem also into a
 * database. To keep data in sync, I would like, for each filesystem operation
 * that succeeds, to check if the file exists on the database. I just do this in
 * the "Getattr()" call, since all other calls will be preceded by a getattr.
 *
 *  - The value of the "st_dev" attribute in the "Getattr()" call are ignored
 *    by fuse and an appropriate anomynous device number is inserted instead.
 *
 *  - The arguments for every request are already verified as much as
 *    possible. This means that, for example "readdir()" is only called with
 *    an existing directory name, "Readlink()" is only called with an existing
 *    symlink, "Symlink()" is only called if there isn't already another
 *    object with the requested linkname, "read()" and "Write()" are only
 *    called if the file has been opened with the correct flags.
 *
 *  - The VFS also takes care of avoiding race conditions:
 *
 *  - while "Unlink()" is running on a specific file, it cannot be interrupted
 *    by a "Chmod()", "Link()" or "Open()" call from a different thread on the
 *    same file.
 *
 *  - while "Rmdir()" is running, no files can be created in the directory
 *    that "Rmdir()" is acting on.
 *
 *  - If a request returns invalid values (e.g. in the structure returned by
 *    "Getattr()" or in the link target returned by "Symlink()") or if a
 *    request appears to have failed (e.g. if a "Create()" request succeds but
 *    a subsequent "Getattr()" (that fuse calls automatically) ndicates that
 *    no regular file has been created), the syscall returns EIO to the
 *    caller.
